# minesweeper.js
a minesweeper port for the browser !

im trying to keep it as original as possible, especially the ui and stuff,
though there are some differences, like the smiley face uwu

all the rules are the same as the original minesweeper :)

it works on phones too and you can try it [here](https://nectarboy.github.io/minesweeper.js) !
